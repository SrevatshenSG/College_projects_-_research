    "needed_additional_info": "More detailed metrics on DataNode resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O) would be helpful. Also, logs from the downstream DataNode in the replication pipeline would provide more insight into the bottleneck. Information about the network topology and any recent network changes would also be beneficial.",

  "summary": "A DataNode (10.10.34.11) is experiencing slow write times when replicating a block to its mirror DataNode. The write operation took 340ms, exceeding the configured threshold of 300ms.",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "impact_assessment": "Slow replication can lead to increased latency for write operations, potentially impacting application performance. If the problem persists or worsens, it could lead to data loss if the primary DataNode fails before replication completes. It can also increase the load on the NameNode due to retries.",
  "root_cause_hypothesis": "The most likely root cause is a bottleneck in the replication pipeline. This could be due to several factors: 1) Network congestion or latency between the DataNode and its mirror. 2) Resource constraints (CPU, disk I/O, memory) on either the source or destination DataNode. 3) High load on the destination DataNode due to other replication or read/write operations. The sequence of events shows multiple blocks being received by the DataNode (10.10.34.11) around the same time (21:56:11), suggesting it might be under heavy load. The 'PacketResponder: ... type=HAS_DOWNSTREAM_IN_PIPELINE terminating' messages indicate the DataNode is part of a replication pipeline, and the slow write is occurring during the mirroring process.",
